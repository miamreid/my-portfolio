            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my online portfolio. It will look a lot like many you've seen before, but I hope my dazzling personality and charming quirks shine through.</p>
            <p>I am currently the Marketing Manager at Stax Payments, a leading FinTech company headquartered in Orlando, FL. More specifically, I work for the fastest-growing business unit within Stax, Stax Connect. It's been a dream of mine to breakthrough into the tech space in some capacity and I continue to pull a seat up to the table where I haven't been invited (yet).</p>
            <p>My marketing background is incredibly diverse, with a range of skillsets and industries served. Content strategy, email development, marketing operations, search engine optimization, and business operations are just a few of the skills I possess within my arsenal. Outside of marketing,  my skillset includes memorizing the lyrics of Panic! At the Disco's entire discography, crafting various projects like knitted beanies and embroidered hoops, or eating an entire bag of Doritos in one sitting.</p>
            <p>You can find me in the central Florida area walking my beautiful golden retriever, Kylo, at our local lake park, or spending time with my parents at their cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Northeastern Tennessee.</p>
