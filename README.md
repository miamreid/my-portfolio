# Mia Reid Portfolio

## Description

In order to showcase my best work to future employers and give them a sense of my personality, I have created a webpage that can be easily viewed from any device. My portfolio contains navigation links that anchor to different sections of the page, such as "About Me", "My Work" and "Contact".

The hero section clearly shows my name and a brief subtitle. Underneath the hero section is clear icons that link to my social profiles, as well as my email address that when clicked, opens the user's email editor to email me.

My portfolio works also showcases the title of each project, so it is clear what the project was. Each project also links to the deployed application for ease of viewing.

I learned most about using the flexbox during this project in order to make my elements responsive to various web browsers.

## Usage

Users that visit my portfolio website are able to read my brief "About Me", view my headshot, navigate to various methods of contacting me, and browse my previous projects. The navigation bar links to the different main sections of my portfolio page using anchor tags. Below the hero, users can see and click on different social profile icons, find my email address, and navigate through the page.
